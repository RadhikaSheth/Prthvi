### The problem Prthvi - Socially Conscious Wealth Management solves

In the world of economic divides & wealth-making rat races, we often miss out on our social and moral responsibilities

We did an internal survey and found that 80% of salaried people in the high-income class donate less than 1% of their incomes to any charity, when we asked them how much they think they should donate, ubiquitously the answer was 1-5% or even more. We built this app to solve important issues people have around quantification, ease of finding causes and donating, and helping and individuals make an impact in a big fight for sustainability
We strongly believe in "If it is in your power to prevent something bad from happening, without sacrificing anything as nearly as important, it is wrong not to do so"

### How we help
#### 1% club
We set a goal of 1% of the person's income which goes towards the causes of his choice. He can explore various causes, and quantify his money into the exact impact that'd be delivered

#### Spare Change Charity
We allow the user to add money to his 1% goal, unnoticeably and continuously by rounding up to 10 each debit transaction and simply adding the spare change is to his goal

#### Employer Matching
To bring about a culture of change, institutions would need to be hand-in-hand with the individuals, employers can transparently match donations of their members and become a part of the 1% club movement

#### Improving spending patterns
Through simple categorization, we show where the person is spending money and we help them set goals to reduce luxury purchases and drive them to charities

#### Driving sustainable Investments
We wish to inform people how their investments are impacting the world. by showing sustainability scores of the mutual funds they are investing in and make better choices. Capitalist forces being the strongest driver of change, we believe driving money to the correct places can bring swift and sustainable change.
